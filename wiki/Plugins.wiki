Arturo actually supports these following sites:
  * http://www.italiasubs.net
  * http://www.subsfactory.it
  * http://www.tvsubtitles.net

These sites are great because subtitles are divided in pages with specific tv series name and season.

If you want to create a new plugin for www.foosubtitles.cz, you have to:
 # go to Arturo plugins folder
 # create a folder named cz
 # create a file named foosubtitles.py (the easiest way is to copy and paste an old plugin and rename it)
 # modify it 

Plugins are just Python files that must adhere to this specification:

{{{
class Scraper(object):    
	#This class has to be called Scraper, that's it!	

    def __init__(self,opener,tvseries_config):       
	#This constructor initialize the opener and, as it is called just one time, can be used for site authentication 

    def get_subtitles_file_url_list(self,tvseries_config):
	#This method does the dirty job!
 	#Starting from tv series url, using regular expression, it has to return a list of url like this:
	#['http://www.foosubtitles.cz/download/sub_episodes1.zip','http://www.foosubtitles.cz/download/sub_episodes2.zip',..]
}}}

Remember, plugins are not forever!
If subtitles repositories change its layout, plugin probably will miserably start to fail.

Have fun!
